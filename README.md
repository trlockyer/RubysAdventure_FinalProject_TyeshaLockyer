Original challenge (50 words) –
In my version of Ruby’s Adventure, I have kept all the basic controls but added some special elements to make my gameplay unique. My goal was to correct everything I missed from the previous challenge, and then to add my own special touches to this game as well. I was able to add a particle effect as well as a fixed version of the “Game Over” signage. My only major issue was that I was unable to figure out how to create a second level and have the player just too it after they win.


Visual change (50 words) – 
One visual element I added is a change in how the typical particle element usable works and used a large image overlay as well. These features were added when Ruby gains health and when she takes damage. I felt that this made the game more immersive for the player. I also added some more “Hard Enemies” around the map. Hard enemies will be in the color red and will take off double the amount of health if touched.

Audio change (50 words) – 
In this version of Ruby’s Adventure, I gave Jambi a voice. If you walk over to talk to him, he will croak just like a frog. Another feature I added is a pause menu with audio. This allows the player to pause their game and restart it at any time during the game. They are minor audio enhancements, but I feel they give the game more character than what I submitted previously.

Gameplay changes (100 words; roughly 50 words per change) –
The biggest gameplay feature I added was a limit to how many cogs Ruby has in store. In my previous version, Ruby had no limit to how many cogs she had in her pouch. In this new version, the player is only given 20 cogs to defeat 12 bots. It adds a little bit of a challenge and if the player runs out of cogs they will have to restart from the beginning. Another feature I added was more bots to the map. The previous challenge only asked for 3 cogs, but in this version, there are 12 cogs to fix. Half of these cogs are normal and will only take off one damage point, but the other cogs that are red will take off two damage points.
